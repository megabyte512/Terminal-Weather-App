# About

This is a program I made for myself to learn about API calls and bash programming language, as well as just to have a terminal-based weather application I can run anytime I have my terminal open.
I can't speak to how well it will translate to other machines: I'm running linux and I believe the $PATH code probably won't migrate well. Not that it's cryptic, I just have my Terminal-Weather-App folder in .local/bin/
Planning on adding more functions and data in the future, but for now, it does the job.

## Known Issues

For some god-forsaken reason, the weekly forecast page will flip day and night rows (and skip a day). It happens inconsistently and everytime I check the .json from NWS, everything looks normal. The python variables just have incorrect data for some reason. The next day everything will work fine.
